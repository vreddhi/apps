# EdgeGrid for Node.js

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/akamai/AkamaiOPEN-edgegrid-node.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/akamai/AkamaiOPEN-edgegrid-node)

This library implements an Authentication handler for the [Akamai OPEN](hhttps://developer.akamai.com/introduction/) EdgeGrid Authentication scheme in Node.js For more infomation visit the [Akamai {OPEN} Developer Portal](https://developer.akamai.com/).

## Installation

`npm install --save edgegrid`

## Example

#### Credentials

To use the Akamai OPEN APIs you must first register and authorize a set of credentials through the [LUNA Control Center](https://control.akamai.com/homeng/view/main). More information on creating and authorizing credentials can be found at [https://developer.akamai.com/introduction/Prov_Creds.html](https://developer.akamai.com/introduction/Prov_Creds.html)

#### .edgerc Authentication

The preferred method of using the library involves providing the path to an '.edgerc' file which contains the authenticaion credentials which will be used to sign your requests.

__NOTE__: Requests to the API are signed with a timestamp and therefore should be executed immediately.

```javascript
var EdgeGrid = require('edgegrid');

var data = 'bodyData';

// Supply the path to your .edgerc file and name
// of the section with authorization to the client
// you are calling (default section is 'default')
var eg = new EdgeGrid({
  path: '/path/to/.edgerc',
  section: 'section-name'
});

eg.auth({
  path: '/diagnostic-tools/v1/locations',
  method: 'GET',
  headers: {},
  body: data
});

eg.send(function(error, response, body) {
  console.log(body);
});
```

An `.edgerc` file contains sections of credentials and is usually hosted in your home directory:

```plaintext
[default]
host = akaa-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.luna.akamaiapis.net/
client_token = akab-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
client_secret = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
access_token = akab-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
max-body = 131072

[section-name]
host = akaa-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.luna.akamaiapis.net/
client_token = akab-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
client_secret = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
access_token = akab-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
max-body = 131072
```

#### Manual Authentication

In addition supplying credentials via an .edgerc file as above, you may also authenticate manually by hard-coding your credential values and passing them to the EdgeGrid client:

```javascript
var clientToken = "akab-client-token-xxx-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
    clientSecret = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx=",
    accessToken = "akab-access-token-xxx-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
    baseUri = "https://akaa-baseurl-xxxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxxx.luna.akamaiapis.net/";

var eg = new EdgeGrid(clientToken, clientSecret, accessToken, baseUri);
```

#### Chaining

Calls using the edgegrid client can also be chained as per the following;

```javascript
...
eg.auth({
  path: 'billing-usage/v1/products',
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {},
  body: data
}).send(function (error, response, body) {
  console.log(body);
});
```
#### Headers

Headers for the request must be supplied in an object as name : value pairs. You do not need to supply form-data headers or content lengths - that will cause authentication headers on the API.

```javascript
eg.auth({
  path: 'billing-usage/v1/products',
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': "application/json"
  }
});
```

#### Body Data

The request BODY can be provided as either an object or as a POST data formed string.


```javascript
// Object
eg.auth({
  path: "/ccu/v2/queues/default",
  method: "POST",
  body: {
    action: "invalidate",
    objects: [
      "https://someurl.com/path"
    ]
  }
});
```
  
#### Query String Pameters

Query string parameters must be supplied in an Object as name : value pairs and 
passed to the `auth` method under the `qs` property.

```javascript
eg.auth({
  path: 'billing-usage/v1/dig',
  method: 'GET',
  headers: {},
  body: {},
  qs: {
    "hostname": "developer.akamai.com.",
    "queryType": "A",
    "location": "Florida, United States"
  }}
}).send(function (error, response, body) {
  console.log(body);
});

// Produces request url similar to:
// http://hostaddress.luna.akamaiapis.net/diagnostic-tools/v1/dig?hostname=developer.akamai.com&queryType=A&location=location
```

#### Debug

Edgegrid accepts a --debug flag which, when passed, will cause the script to
output additional information about the reqest that can be useful in debugging.

The debug option can be passed in as part of the Edgegrid instantiation object
or as a command line argument. 

```javascript
// Set debug via Edgegrid property
var eg = new EdgeGrid({
  path: edgercPath,
  section: sectionName,
  debug: true
});
```

```bash
// Set debug via commmand line argument
$ node src/diagnostic-tools.js --debug
